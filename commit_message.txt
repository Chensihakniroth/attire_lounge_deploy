feat: Integrate MinIO for asset management and fix build errors

This commit integrates MinIO for serving static assets (images and videos)
across the application. It replaces hardcoded local paths with dynamic
MinIO URLs, configured via the MINIO_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT environment variable.

Key changes include:
- Modified `package.json` to configure esbuild for injecting the
  MINIO_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT environment variable during the build process.
- Updated `HomePage.jsx`, `Hero.jsx`, `CollectionsPage.jsx`, and
  `LookbookPage.jsx` to use the dynamically configured MinIO base URL for
  all image and video assets.
- Fixed multiple build-related issues that arose during the integration,
  including:
    - Resolving `ReferenceError: React is not defined` by re-adding missing
      React imports to `HomePage.jsx` and `Hero.jsx`.
    - Correcting a missing `export default HomePage;` statement in
      `HomePage.jsx`.
    - Fixing a typo in a ref assignment within `HomePage.jsx`.
    - Debugged and resolved "Minified React error #306" by ensuring all
      lazy-loaded components were correctly configured and their asset
      paths were valid.
